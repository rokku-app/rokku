## [Unreleased]

### Additions
- Added a "Cover theme style" option (Settings > Appearance) to pick the Material You palette style used for a manga's cover-derived accent color ([@Hiirbaf](https://github.com/Hiirbaf))
- Added a "Load suggestions automatically" option (Settings > Browse) to fetch related-manga suggestions on demand, from the dedicated suggestions screen, instead of every time a manga's details page is opened
- Added a "Show 'Duplicate' badge" option (Settings > Browse) to flag entries already in your library from a different extension, in both a source's browse list and Global Search results
- Added a button to open an available extension's website in a WebView before installing it

### Changes
- Related-manga suggestions are now cached instead of re-fetched from the source every time they're shown - the cache is only refreshed by a manual manga update or a library update
- Renamed "Security" settings to "Security and Privacy"

### Fixes
- Fixed a possible race condition in download notifications when updated from multiple threads at once
- Fixed download/error notifications collapsing under a generic system icon instead of Rokku's when grouped together in the notification shade
- Fixed a restored backup's theme not actually being applied until the app was manually restarted, even though it showed as selected in Settings
- Fixed a crash in the source filter spinner when its entries shrink while a stale selected position was still pointing past the new end
- Fixed a possible crash from duplicate extension entries when the same extension is available from more than one repo
- Fixed extension installs hanging indefinitely with no feedback when started offline, or when the network drops mid-download
- Fixed the manga description opening expanded when navigating from the browse/extension source list instead of staying collapsed like it does from the library
- Fixed "Check for updates" failing with a "Fields ... are required" error on nightly builds when the beta-releases preference was off, since GitHub's "latest release" endpoint never resolves for a repo where every release is a prerelease
- Fixed the "Missing N chapters" chapter-count summary and chapter list divider not counting chapters missing before the earliest available chapter (e.g. a manga starting at chapter 425 instead of 1)
- Fixed scanlator filtering causing a full library scan on every chapter list/backup/recents query, growing slower as the library grows
- Fixed the library still flickering to the wrong covers while scrolling during an active backup restore
- Fixed manga covers never loading, then flickering to the wrong one while scrolling, in the migration source list
- Fixed a crash when updating a single library category whose queued manga list came back empty
- Fixed a settings crash when a stored preference value had been overwritten with an incompatible type
- Fixed a rare crash when switching chapters while a local archive page was still loading
- Fixed a recycled source filter spinner briefly showing the wrong item checked, left over from what it was previously bound to
- Fixed an empty notification staying in the shade after chapter downloads finished
- Fixed the "open log" action on the library update skipped notification opening the "Learn why" help page instead of the log, due to colliding notification actions
- Fixed a crash opening a source's browse page (e.g. from a home screen shortcut) when its extension was no longer installed

### Other
- Bumped Voyager to 2.2.21-1.10.3

## [1.6.1]

### Fixes
- Fixed the "Missing N chapters" chapter-count summary staying hidden when a manga has decimal-numbered chapters
- Fixed manga covers flickering to the wrong cover, or reloading repeatedly, while scrolling the library or Recents
- Fixed covers in Recents disappearing when leaving the tab and coming back
- Fixed manga covers staying blank in Recents when opening the tab, until scrolling

## [1.6.0]

### Additions
- Added a "Missing N chapters" separator in the chapter list, plus a summary below the chapter count (Settings > Library > Behavior)
- Added a "Select all" option to a manga's genre/tag chips, to search by every tag at once
- Added MangaBaka and Hikka tracker support, including OAuth login ([@Hiirbaf](https://github.com/Hiirbaf))
- Added private tracking: mark a tracked entry as private on services that support it (AniList, Bangumi, Kitsu, MangaBaka)
- Added a "Flash the screen on page turn" reader option, for e-ink displays
- Added a "Custom" option to Settings > Library > Global updates, to anchor updates to a specific time of day
- Added inline editing for extension repo URLs; long-press a repo to copy its URL
- Added a configurable free-space floor (Settings > Downloads) that pauses downloads instead of erroring when storage runs low
- Added a "With 'Cancelled' status" library update restriction (Settings > Library)
- Added AniList custom list support to the tracking sheet

### Fixes

- Fixed genre/publisher filters staying empty for sources that fetch filters in the background
- Fixed the filter sheet flickering when expanding a group with many sub-groups
- Fixed MyAnimeList erroring on list entries with partial start/finish reading dates
- Fixed the reader getting stuck loading indefinitely in some scenarios

- Fixed pasting a manga URL into Global Search failing for some sources
- Fixed a source's toggle in extension settings sometimes staying visually off after enabling its language
- Fixed extension icons in the browse list showing the wrong icon, staying blank, or stuck mid-fade ([@Hiirbaf](https://github.com/Hiirbaf))

### Other
- Synced with upstream (yokai): added proguard rules to keep `Serializable` `writeReplace`/`readResolve`, and bumped `okio` to 3.18.1

## [1.5.0]

### Additions
- Add configurable download concurrency (Settings > Downloads): number of simultaneous chapter downloads and simultaneous page downloads per chapter are no longer hardcoded
- Overhaul library search: support `&&`/`||` boolean operators, `-term` negation, `title:`/`author:`/`artist:`/`genre:` field prefixes (in addition to the existing `src:`), and numeric comparators (`>`, `<`, `=`) on `chapters`, `unread`, and `read`
- Pasting a manga URL into Global Search now opens that manga directly if the URL matches an already-installed source, instead of running a full text search across every source
- Add category filtering to the Updates tab (Recents > Updates > display options)

### Changes
- Debounce library search input (250ms) so refiltering no longer runs on every keystroke
- Spoof `Sec-CH-UA` client hints in WebView to match the user agent
- Update default user agent to Chrome 149

### Fixes
- Fix slow backup restore with large libraries by batching manga restoration into chunked database transactions instead of committing every manga individually
- Fix backup restore inserting duplicate chapters when a backup contains the same chapter URL more than once
- Fix `X-Requested-With` spoofing leaking to unrelated callers
- Fix backup restore posting a system notification update on every single manga (throttled by Android and further slowing large restores); it now only updates once per batch
- Fix backup restore re-querying the full category list from the database once per manga instead of once for the whole restore
- Fix backup restore querying the database once per reading-history entry instead of once per manga, which made restoring a backup with a lot of reading history disproportionately slow
- Fix the same one-query-per-history-entry issue when *creating* a backup, which made backing up a library with a lot of reading history disproportionately slow
- Fix backup creation dispatching every manga's queries individually (one dispatcher context-switch each) instead of batching them into chunked transactions, which was the dominant cost for large libraries
- Fix backup creation's chapter queries needlessly joining the internal scanlator-filter view (a recursive query with no per-manga predicate pushdown, so it re-scanned the whole library on every call) even when the scanlator filter isn't used, which was the actual dominant cost for large libraries
- Harden the mitigation for a rare crash when bulk-removing/migrating library entries (a sqldelight race between a library query and a concurrent write): retry with a short delay until it clears instead of giving up after a single immediate retry
- Fix "Check for updates" never finding new nightly builds: it was querying the stable release repo with a stale GitHub username, so nightly checks silently failed and update links pointed to the wrong repo

## [1.4.0]

### Additions
- Add a `src:` search prefix to filter the library by source name or ID (e.g. `src:MangaDex` or `src:2499283573021220255`)
- Add options to immediately fetch metadata and/or the chapter list from the source when adding a manga to the library, instead of waiting for the next library update (Settings > Library, both off by default)

### Fixes
- Fix a manga's cover sometimes staying blank in the library grid after adding it, until the item was rebound (e.g. by long-pressing it)
- Fix covers never loading in Global Search and Migration, caused by the list rebinding/resorting fast enough to keep cancelling each cover's own in-flight load before it could finish; both now render covers the same Coil/Compose way as the Library and Browse screens
- Fix a broken-image icon showing while a Global Search/Migration cover was still loading or searching, instead of a neutral placeholder
- Fix the migration screen's toolbar title staying stuck at "(0/0)" instead of showing the real manga count
- Fix "Migrate All"'s progress dialog not showing the final count for a moment before closing, most noticeable when migrating a single manga
- Fix "Migrate All"'s progress counting every manga it looked at instead of only the ones actually migrated (e.g. migrating 3 of 4 manga showed "4/4" instead of "3/4")
- Fix automatic migration matching only trying the manga's exact full title against a source's search, missing manga a manual search could still find; it now also tries shorter word combinations as a fallback, with a stricter similarity requirement so a coincidentally shared generic word can't match a completely unrelated manga

### Other
- Enable and fix Kotlin style checks (`kotlinter`) project-wide; it was declared but never actually wired up, so it had never run
- Add CI workflows for Kotlin style checks and CodeQL security analysis
- Document the commit message convention in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Publish nightly build releases to a separate `rokku-nightly` repo instead of the main one, keeping its tags/releases list to actual versions

## [1.3.2]

### Fixes
- Fix the app icon showing as a generic system icon instead of Rokku's own artwork in condensed/bundled notification stacks on some OEM launchers (e.g. MIUI lock screen), caused by the themed/monochrome launcher icon never being wired up since the Yokai fork
- Fix the app's own self-update getting stuck showing "Installing" forever if the install confirmation notification was missed, the same issue fixed for extension updates in 1.3.1

## [1.3.1]

### Additions
- Support the `mihon://extension-store` deep link for adding extension repos, alongside the existing `tachiyomi://add-repo` one (contributed by [@Hiirbaf](https://github.com/Hiirbaf))

### Fixes
- Fix extension updates getting stuck showing "Installing" forever if the OS silently blocked the install confirmation dialog (common when updating an already-installed extension), leaving no way out except uninstalling and reinstalling the extension
- Fix the reader not exiting fullscreen/immersive mode correctly in split-screen or multi-window mode
- Fix the app bar's toolbar mode not resyncing after entering/exiting split screen
- Fix the floating browse toolbar recalculating its bottom margin (including keyboard insets) on every scroll on Android 10 and below
- Fix the favorite button's long-press category picker letting a stray tap open a menu underneath it
- Fix a crash when exiting the reader back to manga details with no shared element to animate

### Other
- Upgrade to Android Gradle Plugin 9.3.1 and Gradle 9.6.1, matching Mihon

## [1.3.0]

### Additions
- Add a persistent "Library update errors" screen listing manga that failed to update, with select-all/individual selection and bulk migration to another source (ported from Komikku)

### Fixes
- Fix a "ghost" download group summary notification surviving if the app process was killed while downloads were still queued (e.g. swiping the app away from recents)

## [1.2.5]

### Fixes
- Fix a "ghost" download notification staying behind after all downloads finished

## [1.2.4]

### Fixes
- Fix library update discarding a source's updated manga details (cover, description, status, etc.) whenever it returned them together with the chapter list, instead of only when explicitly requested, and doing a redundant extra request for details it already had
- Fix the download icon in the chapter list getting stuck instead of animating while a chapter downloads, if the row scrolled off-screen and back mid-download
- Fix the "New chapters found" notification sometimes showing no content when only one manga had an update, and its "Skipped" counterpart opening the help page instead of the skip log when tapped
- Restore the animated download icon (matching upstream) instead of a static one, and stop the download notification's group summary from re-posting on every single downloaded page, which could make it visibly flicker/reshuffle in the notification shade

## [1.2.3]

### Fixes
- Fix "Data and storage" opening the older, less polished settings screen; it's now the primary screen reached from Settings
- Fix "Data and storage" (and every other Settings screen using the large collapsible app bar) freezing mid-scroll until the screen was reopened
- Fix the "In library" badge not showing on the comfortable grid layout when browsing a source or viewing related manga
- Fix extension installs/updates sometimes getting stuck showing "Downloading" or the install button after finishing, until the extensions sheet was reopened
- Fix the manga's own source being dropped from the migration search when more than one source was available
- Fix the app version showing a redundant "Release" prefix in About
- Fix grouped download notifications sometimes showing a generic icon instead of Rokku's

## [1.2.2]

### Additions
- Add an option to pick what to restore from a backup (library, categories, app settings, source settings, extension repos), instead of it being all-or-nothing
- Back up and restore custom extension repos along with the rest of your data

### Fixes
- Fix "Data and storage" defaulting to the experimental settings screen instead of the stable one (single tap now opens the stable screen; long-press still opens the experimental one, matching upstream)
- Fix in-app updates sometimes getting stuck on "Installing" forever, by falling back to a tap-to-confirm notification if the install dialog is blocked by the OS
- Fix "Help translate" linking to Yokai's translation project instead of Rokku's

## [1.2.1]

### Fixes
- Fix chapters from some sources (e.g. Asura Scans, Hive Scans, Kayn, Vortex) failing to open with a "Refresh Chapter List" error, caused by the local database silently discarding the `memo` metadata some sources rely on to validate a chapter before loading it

## [1.2.0]

### Additions
- Add a "Suggestions" section to the manga details page and a dedicated full-list screen, showing related titles from the same source (Settings → Browse, off by default)

### Fixes
- Fix the webtoon reader visibly resizing/jumping when transitioning between pages split from a long strip image
- Fix source search/browse results not reflecting a manga's library status if it was favorited a few screens deeper in the navigation (e.g. via a suggested manga)

### Other
- Standardize Settings descriptions to not end with a trailing period

## [1.1.8]

### Fixes
- Fix manga details sometimes only loading info or chapters (never both) until a manual reload, caused by two concurrent calls to the same source request racing against its concurrency guard (contributed by [@Hiirbaf](https://github.com/Hiirbaf))
- Fix in-app updates sometimes getting stuck on "Installing" forever on some OEM devices, by falling back to a manual install prompt if the install confirmation never appears

## [1.1.7]

### Fixes
- Fix migration screen crashing (double-unlock) and getting progressively slower with each migrated manga
- Fix manga description showing blank when opening from the library until a manual refresh
- Fix library selection being cleared every time a background chapter download completed
- Fix chapter list stutter and a stuck download-completion animation while other manga download in the background
- Fix a ~1s freeze and missed taps when marking a single chapter as read/bookmarked
- Fix the per-category library update spinner not animating, or getting stuck off
- Fix a UI freeze when starting a category update while another one was already running
- Add progress feedback to Migrate All / Copy All

## [1.1.6]

### Fixes
- Fix editing an extension's settings (e.g. a custom URL) crashing with a `ClassCastException`
- Fix extensions targeting the current `tachiyomix 1.6` protocol failing to load correctly: the `SManga`/`SChapter` interfaces were missing the `memo` field some extensions rely on (contributed by [@Sacha1016](https://github.com/Sacha1016))
- Fix `SManga.copy()` silently dropping the `update_strategy` field
- Fix the About screen's Discord/website links pointing at Mihon's own community, which this fork isn't affiliated with
- Fix download notifications using generic Android system icons instead of this app's own

### Other
- CI: docs-only pushes (README/CHANGELOG) no longer trigger a nightly build/release

## [1.1.5]

### Fixes
- Fix a data-loss bug where toggling "Download with ID" could cause already-downloaded chapters to be misidentified as orphaned and deleted during download cleanup
- Fix a slight shake/readjustment while scrolling down in the webtoon (continuous scroll) reader, caused by pages reflowing right as they finish decoding into view
- Fix remaining links/identifiers still pointing at the original Yokai maintainer: the About screen's GitHub link, the debug build's "view source" link, and the User-Agent sent to tracker services (Anilist, Bangumi, Kavita, Kitsu, MangaUpdates, Shikimori)
- Manga details FAB now shrinks/extends on scroll, and the chapter list no longer sits behind it (contributed by [@Hiirbaf](https://github.com/Hiirbaf))

### Changes
- Removed the BETA tag from "Use staggered grid", "Download with ID", and "Scan external storages for entries" after testing and, where needed, fixing the underlying issues that justified the tag

### Other
- CI: release/beta builds now fail early with a clear error if `CHANGELOG.md` has no matching version section, instead of silently publishing with an empty body
- CI: PR builds now boot the release APK on an emulator and fail if it crashes on launch, to catch R8-shrinking issues (like the one fixed in 1.1.4) before they reach a release
- Removed `.github/FUNDING.yml`, which pointed GitHub's Sponsor button at the original Yokai maintainer's accounts

## [1.1.4]

### Fixes
- Fix extensions that decompress zstd/brotli-encoded responses crashing the app outright (native abort, no error/log shown) in release/nightly builds; R8 was stripping the native decoder classes since they're only reachable via JNI

## [1.1.3]

### Other
- Raise `minSdk` to 26 (matching Mihon) to fix `AbstractMethodError` crashes in extensions (e.g. MangaDotNet) compiled assuming native Java 8 default-interface-method dispatch, which Android doesn't support below API 24; this drops support for Android 6.0/7.0/7.1

## [1.1.2]

### Fixes
- Fix extensions that decompress zstd-encoded responses crashing with `NoClassDefFoundError: okhttp3.zstd.Zstd` (the fix in 1.1.1 restored the brotli dependency but missed zstd)

## [1.1.1]

### Fixes
- Fix extensions that reference `okhttp3.brotli.Brotli` or `okhttp3.zstd.Zstd` directly (e.g. WeebCentral, MangaDotNet) crashing with `NoClassDefFoundError` since 1.1.0

### Other
- CI: make the manual release/beta build actually set the app's version (previously it only renamed the GitHub tag/release, the installed app kept showing an unrelated version number)
- CI: normalize and quote the version input so a stray space no longer breaks the whole build
- CI: push the version tag before creating the GitHub release, avoiding a race that could leave the release "untagged"
- CI: grant `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permissions for releases and test check runs (newer repos default to read-only)

## [1.1.0]

### Fixes
- Fix in-app update checker pointing at the original Yokai's GitHub repo instead of this fork's (was permanently showing a fake "update available")
- Removed forced Brotli/gzip-bypass network interceptors (fixed some sources but broke others that treat them as a bot-detection signal; see the known issue below, fixed in 1.1.1)

### Changes
- Replaced the Yokai notification icon with a Rokku one

### Known issues (fixed in 1.1.1)
- Some extensions that reference `okhttp3.brotli.Brotli` directly crash on load

## [1.0.1]

### Changes
- Own `applicationId` (`app.rokku`) instead of reusing the original Yokai's, so this fork can be installed alongside it without conflicting
- Removed Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics (was still pointing at the original Yokai maintainer's project)

## [1.0.0]

First release under the Rokku name. Everything below was inherited as broken from Yokai/pre-fork and fixed here; see the README for full fork history and credits.

### Fixes
- Fix Keiyoushi extension compatibility: extension lib version window was capped below what current extensions ship as, rejecting all of them
- Fix `Source`/`CatalogueSource` interface to match the current extension API (`tachiyomix 1.6`), including the combined `getMangaUpdate` call
- Fix "add extension repository" only accepting a URL ending in `/index.min.json`, rejecting the `repo.json`/`index.pb` URLs Keiyoushi now points users to
- Add support for the newer protobuf/JSON "ExtensionStore" repository index format, with the legacy `index.min.json` array kept as a fallback
- Fix Shikimori tracker using a decommissioned domain (`shikimori.one` → `shikimori.io`)
- Fix downloader always restarting interrupted page downloads from scratch instead of resuming them
- Fix download notifications not respecting the Android 13+ notification permission
- Fix Shizuku extension installer relying on a private API and shelling out to `pm`, a source of silent install failures; now uses the proper (if hidden) `PackageInstaller` session APIs
- Fix extension install broadcast receiver being unnecessarily exported

### Changes

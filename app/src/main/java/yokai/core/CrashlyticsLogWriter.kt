    /**
     * Skips exceptions that are never actionable from app code: coroutine cancellation
     * (normal control flow), pure device/network connectivity failures (DNS, timeout,
     * TLS handshake, connection reset), a source's own server erroring out (5xx, whether
     * raised via our own HttpException or a source/extension's own HTTP client),
     * rejecting auth (401/403), or answering 404 for a resource that isn't there (a
     * dead or misconfigured extension repo URL, or a legacy repo with no repo.json -
     * ExtensionApi and ExtensionRepoService both fall back cleanly), and the user's
     * downloads folder, a downloaded page file, or the backup destination
     * (BackupCreateException) becoming inaccessible (permission revoked, file/folder
     * moved/deleted, storage removed - the backup failure is still shown to the user as a
     * notification) - none of these reflect a Rokku bug, and recording them buries real
     * non-fatals in noise. Walks the whole cause chain since some call sites (e.g.
     * MangaCoverFetcher) wrap these in a generic IOException before it reaches here.
     *
     * Also skips two more transient, self-healing cases: an extension's dex not being
     * readable yet (empty DexPathList) when ExtensionManager's startup scan races an
     * in-progress install/update - ExtensionInstallReceiver reloads that package on its
     * own once the real PACKAGE_ADDED/PACKAGE_REPLACED broadcast lands - and a downloaded
     * page file disappearing between the post-download success check and CBZ archiving
     * (external storage/media scanner interference), which Downloader already surfaces
     * to the user as a failed download.
     *
     * Also skips a MyAnimeList tracker session expiring (MyAnimeListInterceptor already
     * surfaces a clear re-login message to the user instead) and a source extension's own
     * auth interceptor rejecting a request as unauthorized (a 401 the extension raises as
     * a plain IOException rather than through our HttpException, so it doesn't reach the
     * isAuthError check above) - neither reflects a Rokku bug.
     *
     * Also skips Hikka/MangaBaka trying to JSON-decode their saved OAuth token preference
     * on first use when the user never logged in (empty preference, decoding fails as EOF) -
     * Hikka.loadOAuth and MangaBaka.restoreToken already catch this and return null, so the
     * tracker just starts logged out.
     *
     * Also skips AniList's tracker refresh not finding the manga in the user's list anymore
     * (e.g. removed/unlinked directly on AniList's site) - not a Rokku bug.
     *
     * Also skips the OS refusing to promote a library update job to a foreground service
     * (android.app.ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException, API 31+, matched by class name
     * since it doesn't extend IllegalStateException) - tryToSetForeground() already treats
     * this as best-effort and lets the update proceed without the progress notification.
     *
     * Also skips a history upsert hitting a FOREIGN KEY constraint failure - the chapter the
     * reader/recents/backup was recording progress for was deleted from the database in the
     * meantime (chapter list refreshed, manga removed). HistoryRepositoryImpl already catches
     * this and skips the row; there's simply no chapter left to attach the history to.
     *
     * Also skips a batch of cover/reader/browse conditions that only reflect a source or the
     * network misbehaving, never a Rokku bug: MangaCoverFetcher raising a source's HTTP error
     * status ("HTTP 4xx/5xx …"), a missing/invalid cover URL in the source's metadata
     * ("Invalid image", "No cover specified"), an HTTP/2 stream reset ("stream was reset: …",
     * including covers cancelled mid-scroll), a redirect loop ("Too many follow-up requests"),
     * a source's own Cloudflare challenge not clearing ("Failed to bypass Cloudflare"), a
     * source returning an empty page list (NoPagesException) or a locked chapter
     * ("Chapter locked"), a browse query with no matches (NoResultsException), the related-
     * manga / deep-link path resolving to an uninstalled source (SourceNotFoundException), and
     * an online reader page's disk-cache entry being evicted between listing and reading it
     * (FileNotFoundException under chapter_disk_cache - the page just reloads).
